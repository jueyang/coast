The first site I built in 2010, back then jQuery was a big deal to me and the code looked like [this](https://github.com/jueyang/coast/blob/50fb642c424808e3f496c6e7c6584948a0299ed8/js/app.js#L147).

A couple years later I updated the site. The content stayed the same, but the interaction and subtlties in the code changed. Time, does great things.
